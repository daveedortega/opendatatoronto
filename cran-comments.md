## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Quoted "City of Toronto Open Data Portal" in the DESCRIPTION to indicate that
  this entire phrase is a title (and should have title case).
* Replaced `\dontrun` with `\donttest` in examples.
* Documented return values for all functions.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.5.2
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R-devel, R 3.6.1, R 3.5.3
* win-builder (devel)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
